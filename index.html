<p>Senior Software Engineer focused on backend systems and cloud-native architectures. I specialise in Go and microservices on Kubernetes across AWS, GCP and Azure, primarily in fintech, insurance and SaaS. I’m comfortable owning work end-to-end: understanding requirements, designing systems, implementing services, and operating them in production with strong observability and CI/CD. Increasingly, my work centres on technical leadership: setting patterns, unblocking teams and driving reliable delivery.</p>

Self-hosted recipe application using Go, Echo, templ and Tailwind, backed by PostgreSQL. Uses Docker and a custom migration tool to keep schema changes repeatable and safe, and serves as a full end-to-end example of a small content platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Migrator – Postgres migration library and CLI (Go)</strong><br>
Lightweight migration tool that can run as a library at app startup or as a standalone CLI in CI/CD. Designed to keep schema and data migrations explicit, versioned and easy to automate across projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workspacer – Tmux workspace/session manager (Go, TUI)</strong><br>

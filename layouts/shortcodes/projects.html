## Personal Projects

- **Fintrack – Personal finance tracker (Go, templ, HTMX, SQLite)**
  CLI + web app for managing accounts and transactions, built with production intent rather than as a toy. Go backend with SQLite and migrations, templ/HTMX frontend, and a small provider layer for LLM/AI integration. Focuses on clean domain modelling, predictable data migrations and a workflow that mirrors real deployment (Docker, CI-friendly layout).

- **Recipe CMS – Full-stack recipe manager (Go, Echo, templ, HTMX, PostgreSQL)**
  Self-hosted recipe application using Go, Echo, templ, HTMX and Tailwind, backed by PostgreSQL. Uses Docker and a custom migration tool to keep schema changes repeatable and safe, and serves as a full end-to-end example of a small content platform.

- **Migrator – Postgres migration library and CLI (Go)**
  Lightweight migration tool that can run as a library at app startup or as a standalone CLI in CI/CD. Designed to keep schema and data migrations explicit, versioned and easy to automate across projects.

- **Workspacer – Tmux workspace/session manager (Go, TUI)**
  Developer tool to manage tmux sessions and project workspaces from a terminal UI, aimed at speeding up daily development workflows and making multi-project context switching simpler.

- **Stackr – Homelab orchestration (Go, CLI, Docker)**
  CLI tool and daemon (stackrd) for managing self-hosted Docker stacks. Handles env-driven configuration, stack definitions and orchestration, automatically wiring stacks to domains, ports, storage pools and metrics dashboards.

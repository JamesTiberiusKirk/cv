## Professional Achievements

- **Delivered ScoutNonLeague platform at Atom Web Development** – Built a full-stack platform connecting non-league football players with clubs in England (and eventually world wide), delivered end-to-end in a short timeframe. Designed and implemented the complete system in Go with Echo, PostgreSQL, templ and HTMX, featuring multi-version CV system, events/opportunities, real-time messaging via WebSockets, Stripe subscriptions and guardian management. Established production-grade architecture with scalability best practices for both codebase growth and runtime load, clean Repository/Service/Handler patterns, and Playwright E2E tests. Delivered a complete development strategy and framework, and trained a junior developer to maintain and extend the platform.

- **Led large-scale templ migration at Aviva** – Planned and executed a migration to the templ Go library across hundreds of files in a core repository under a controlled code freeze, with custom tooling and automated diff-based testing to minimise risk. Worked closely with, and effectively led, the test team to validate changes. The migration modernised the toolchain and removed a major bottleneck, significantly improving delivery speed and long-term throughput of safe changes.

- **Stabilised contractor-built platform at Aviva** – Joined a small, startup-style team taking over a contractor-built car insurance platform. Rewrote, refactored and rebuilt key services, introduced clearer patterns and testing, and helped turn the prototype into a maintainable, owned product codebase, reducing core production issues and improving developer efficiency.

- **Built auditing and reporting at Form3** – Delivered a feature that records incoming payment events and requests for auditing and partner reporting, using a combination of event streams, synchronous APIs and AWS Athena queries over stored data to provide statistical views of product usage and support compliance.

- **Prototyped dashboards and mobile management at NCR** – Developed an early statistics dashboard and a prototype mobile management app for NCR terminals, demonstrating how Docker packaging and modern deployment could support operational visibility and control. The concepts were taken into production and used by customers to better monitor and maintain their terminal estates.

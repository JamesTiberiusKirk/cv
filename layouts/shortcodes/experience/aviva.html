{{ `#### Full Stack Engineer (Go / Next.js) – Aviva
**Mar 2023 – Jun 2025**

- Joined a small, startup-style team within Aviva, taking over a contractor-built codebase for the Aviva Zero green car insurance platform and turning it into a stable, maintainable product.
- Pioneered a new technology stack using Go on AWS Lambda for backend services and Next.js for customer portals, establishing patterns for cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.
- Led a large templating migration to the templ Go library, reformatting hundreds of files in a central repository under a coordinated code freeze. Built custom tooling and automated diff-based testing to safely run and validate the migration, working closely with QA/testing to minimise regressions.
- Acted as one of the main Go engineers on the team, helping others learn Go idioms and standards through pairing, code reviews and example patterns.
- Built backend flows and frontend views enabling customers to perform mid-term adjustments on their car insurance policies through tailored journeys, with appropriate validation, auditing and error handling.
- Collaborated with product, QA and architecture teams to design, deliver and roll out features end-to-end, including monitoring and post-deployment follow-up.` | markdownify }}

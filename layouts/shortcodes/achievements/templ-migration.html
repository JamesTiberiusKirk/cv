{{ `- **Led large-scale templ migration at Aviva** – Planned and executed a migration to the templ Go library across hundreds of files in a core repository under a controlled code freeze, with custom tooling and automated diff-based testing to minimise risk. Worked closely with, and effectively led, the test team to validate changes. The migration modernised the toolchain and removed a major bottleneck, significantly improving delivery speed and long-term throughput of safe changes.` | markdownify }}

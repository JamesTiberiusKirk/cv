# Bio

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

&nbsp; I chose to study Applied Computing simply because I could not see myself doing any other
course or working any other job field. My decision to go into this field was simply out of passion.
Because of this I am very eager to learn new technologies and skills.

&nbsp; In the tech field, my interests are mostly in back-end development, dev-ops, general program-
ming/scripting, security and just generally keeping up with tech news, specifically in the security,
Open-Source and hardware sections.
